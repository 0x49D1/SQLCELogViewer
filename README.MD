*WHY TO I NEED THING?*

After some time of working with NLog i've found that keeping logs in files is not that comfortable, and moved to local database. This thing opens the database(with predifined structure for logging) and shows records in sortable/searchable grid, so that you can quickly find just informational messages appeared 2 days before..

Good luck.

*INSTALLATION*

You can install SQLCELogViewer *clickonce* right from [codeplex](http://sqlcelogviewer.codeplex.com/).

Also you will need to include [Logger.sdf](https://bitbucket.org/0x49D1/sqlcelogviewer/downloads/Logger.sdf)(SQL CE database for logger to write to) and sample [NLog.config](https://bitbucket.org/0x49D1/sqlcelogviewer/downloads/NLog.config).

*CODE*

You always can [fork](https://bitbucket.org/0x49D1/sqlcelogviewer/fork) the project.
